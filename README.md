# Huawei FusionSolar Kiosk API to InfluxDB, MQTT and PVOutput relay
This is a python project intended to fetch data from the **Huawei FusionSolar** public **kiosk** and relay it to **InfluxDB** and/or **PVOutput.org** and/or **MQTT**. 

Additionally this project can also fetch and relay grid usage data from the Dutch meetdata.nl API provider by **Kenter**.

Credits go to the [Grott project](https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott). Many bits of code, structure and ideas are borrowed from there.

# Installation
This project is currently intented to run as a Docker container and fetches its config from environment variables. Yet the project can be run standalone. 
A local settings file (such as .yml or .ini) has not been implemented yet, but pvconf.py can easily be modified to override standard settings.

Check out [Examples/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/JasperE84/PyFusionSolarDataRelay/blob/main/Examples/docker-compose.yml) for a docker configuration example.

# Breaking changes in the release
The fusionsolarinterval configuration paramters has been replaced by two cron settings defaulting to poll fusionsolar data each half our.

# About Huawei FusionSolar Kiosk mode
FusionSolar is Huawei's online monitoring platform for their PV inverters. FusionSolar features a kiosk mode. When enabled, a kiosk url is generated which is publically accessible. The kiosk web app fetches its data from a JSON backend. It is this backend where this project fetches the PV data. 
Fetching data from the kiosk mode can be beneficial to those without direct access to the official API and/or the inverter Modbus-TCP. For instance when the inverter is logging to fusionsolar over a direct cellular connection configured and fitted by an installer unable to provide API access rights to third parties.

# About Kenter's API and matching PVOutput intervals
Fusion solar data fetching is planned by cron in order to exactly specify at what times the data should reload. This way, it is possible to synchronise the intervals of fusionsolar and gridkenter datapoints, which end up showing on PVOutput. That's relevant because if the gridkenter data class is fetched, meetdata.nl does not provide live measurements. Instead it provides historic measurements with a certain interval (15 minutes interval with the most recent data point 3 days old in my case). If this interval doesn't match the fusionsolar interval, then PVOutput will show distorted graphs because it won't have a datapoint for both PV production and grid usage for each interval. (Fusionsolar kiosk API only updates each half hour). See [this url](https://crontab.guru/) for help with finding the right cron config.

# About PVOutput.org
[PVOutput.org](https://pvoutput.org/) is a free service for sharing and comparing PV output data.

# About InfluxDB
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is an open source time series database on which dashboards can easily be built. For instance using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

# About MQTT
MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices. MQTT can be used to relay the PV data to various home automation software such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

# About Kenter's meetdata.nl
Kenter provides measurement services for **commercially rented** grid transformers. This project can fetch energy usage data from this API and post it to InfluxDB and PVOutput. MQTT is not supported for posting Kenter data, as Kenter's latest measurement data is usually 3 days old.

# Grafana solar PV dashboard elements on Xibo digital signage system
I'm using individual the elements on this dashboard to show the PV solar statistics on a free and open source [Xibo Digital Signage](https://xibo.org.uk/) narrowcasting system. 

Take the following steps to achieve this:
1. Enable Grafana anonymous mode (see [Examples/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/JasperE84/PyFusionSolarDataRelay/blob/main/Examples/docker-compose.yml))
2. Create a new layout in Xibo and add some regions
3. Back in Grafana, open the dashboard and click 'Share' in the grafana individual graph dropdown dialog (not the entire dashboard, but the individual graph on the dashboard)
4. Share in "Link" mode (do not use snapshot or embed)
5. Back in Xibo, drop the "Webpage" widget on your region
6. Configure the webpage widget to show the link copied in step 4.
7. Optionally alter the url to format like `&from=now-12h` instead of the default `&from=1655015379544&to=1655058579544`
7. Publish the layout, the graphs will now fit nicely in the width/height of the defined regions.

Result:
